    ============================== ==============================================================================  =======================  ======

    This component in addition to the assumed safety requirements ensures freedom from interference with respect to memory with up to ASIL D.


    Configuration Constraints
    =========================

    This component does not have configuration constraints.


    Additional Verification Measures
    ================================

    .. SMI:: SMI-JSON-PRIVATE-InitializeJSONWithIoIntegrityStream

       **The user of the embedded software shall ensure that IoIntegrityStream is used when initializing vaJson from an input stream where safety requirements are assumed.**

       This SMI is stated as PRIVATE and thus it is applicable only to direct users of vaJson.

       During initialization of vaJson, a user-initialized input filestream can be passed. The Technical Reference uses std::fstream::in as an example.
       If safety requirements are to be assumed, the user shall verify that the integrirty of the provided filestream is ensured.

       Verification can be performed e.g. by review.

    .. SMI:: SMI-JSON-InitializeJSONWithBuffer

       **The user of the embedded software shall ensure the integrity of the character buffer used to initialize vaJson where safety requirements are assumed.**

       During initialization of vaJson, a user-initialized character buffer can be passed. The Technical Reference uses ara::core::StringView and
       ara::core::Span<char> as an example.  If safety requirements are to be assumed, the user shall verify the data integrity of the provided character buffer.

       This SMI is required to ensure freedom from interference of vaJson.
       Verification can be performed e.g. by review.

    .. SMI:: SMI-JSON-InitializeJSONWithFilePath

       **The user of the embedded software shall ensure the integrity of a file whose path is used to intialize vaJson where safety requirements are assumed.**

       During initialization of vaJson, a file path can be passed. If safety requirements are to be assumed, the user shall verify the integrity of
       the file to which the path points. The file's integrity must be ensured for as long as the JsonData or ParserFile object exists.

       Verification can be performed e.g. by review, verifying that the file integrity is guaranteed by the file system and the OS.

    Safety Requirements Required From Other Components
    ==================================================

    .. SMI:: SMI-JSON-PRIVATE-LibVac

       **This component requires common types/API functionality as an assumed safety requirement (TSR-112401, TSR-112402, TSR-112404-TSR-112409) from LibVac.**

       The used libvac library shall provide common types/API functionality as safety requirement.
       If the libvac library from the embedded software is used, this dependency  is fulfilled.

    .. SMI:: SMI-JSON-PRIVATE-LibOsAbstraction

       **This component requires general OS related functionality as an assumed safety requirement (TSR-112401, TSR-112402, TSR-112404-TSR-112409) from LibOsAbstraction.**

       This includes functionality for converting integers between host and network byte order.

       The used libosabstraction library shall provide functionality byte order conversions as safety requirement.
       If the libosabstraction library from the embedded software is used, this dependency is fulfilled.

    .. SMI:: SMI-JSON-PRIVATE-CharacterConversion

       **This component requires conversions of primitive types to strings as an assumed safety requirement (TSR-112401, TSR-112402, TSR-112404-TSR-112409) from CharacterConversion.**

       The used characterconversion library shall provide functionality to perform conversions between primitive types and strings.
       If the characterconversion library from the embedded software is used, this dependency is fulfilled.



    Dependencies to Hardware
    ========================

    This component does not use a direct hardware interface.
