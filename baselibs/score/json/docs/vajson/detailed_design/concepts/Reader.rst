Templates and Polymorphism
==========================

..
  Concept:: DSGN-Concept-Polymorphism

  There are two parser interfaces available, one using static polymorphism and another one using dynamic polymorphism.

  Interface with Static Polymorphism
  ----------------------------------

  A child parser instantiates the parent parser it is derived from using its own type as a template argument.
  This is known as the "Curiously Recurring Template Pattern" (CRTP) or "F-bound polymorphism" and is a form of static
  polymorphism.
  This way, whenever the parent parser accesses the child parser, e.g. to call one of the callbacks, it issues a static
  cast for the child parser's type.
  The child parser does not necessarily need to implement all callbacks.
  If a callback is not implemented by the child parser, i.e. it does not override the corresponding method of the parent
  parser, the method of the parent parser is called instead.

  Advantages:
  - Allows for better optimization

  Disadvantages:
  - Provides a compile-time interface, i.e. it overrides functions

  Interface with Dynamic Polymorphism
  -----------------------------------

  The interface using dynamic polymorphism is a run-time interface, i.e. the correct callbacks are assigned during
  run-time.

  Advantages:
  - No overloaded functions and templates
  - Reduced AUTOSAR code violations

  Disadvantages:
  - There may be a performance impact due to virtual method table (VMU) organization


Parser Mixins
=============

..
  Concept:: DSGN-Concept-Parser-Mixins

  The class CompositionParser is intended to provide pre-defined parser functions to an existing class for commonly
  occurring JSON elements (single values and compounds).
  These pre-defined functions can be called by the user at any time to parse the following JSON element.
