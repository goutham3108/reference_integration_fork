Overview
--------

<Brief summary of the architecture.>

Requirements Linked to Component Architecture
---------------------------------------------

see "fulfills" links of architecture needs

Description

<General Description>

<Design Decisions - For the documentation of the decision the :need:`gd_temp__change_decision_record` can be used.>

<Design Constraints>

Rationale Behind Architecture Decomposition
*******************************************

due to low complexity, no need for further decomposition

Static Architecture
-------------------

The components are designed to cover the expectations from the feature architecture
(i.e. if already exists a definition it should be taken over and enriched).

A component can optional also consist of lower level components to further structure the architecture. The component and its static views can also optionally use interfaces provided by other components.

   :security: YES
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :status: valid

      {{ draw_component(need(), needs) }}

Dynamic Architecture
--------------------

not needed, just routing of commands and answers
