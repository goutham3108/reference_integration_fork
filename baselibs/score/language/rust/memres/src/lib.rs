//! Safe Rust wrapper for C++ `score::cpp::pmr::memory_resource` handles.
//!
//! This crate exposes three kinds of PMR resources from the `score::cpp`
//! library:
//!
//! - [`ResourceKind::Monotonic`]: a monotonic buffer resource backed by a
//!   C++-allocated buffer of a fixed size.
//! - [`ResourceKind::UnsynchronizedPool`]: a single-threaded pool resource.
//! - The process-global default resource returned by
//!   `score::cpp::pmr::get_default_resource()`, created via
//!   [`MemoryResource::default_resource()`].
//!
//! Each resource carries a compile-time [`thread_safety`] marker (`Local` or
//! `Shared`) so that `Send`/`Sync` propagate soundly to every borrower; see
//! the [`MemoryResource`] documentation.
//!
//! Both owned resource kinds support a **hermetic** mode. When `hermetic =
//! true`, any attempt to allocate beyond the pre-allocated pool logs a fatal
//! message and calls `std::abort()` on the C++ side, preventing any fallback
//! to the system heap.  When `hermetic = false`, a warning is logged and the
//! allocation falls back to `score::cpp::pmr::new_delete_resource()`.
