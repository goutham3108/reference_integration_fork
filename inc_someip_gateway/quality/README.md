# Quality Infrastructure

This directory contains quality-related Bazel configuration used by tests in this repository.

## Contents

- `integration_testing/`: shared macro and environment/plugin artifacts for integration tests.

## Integration Testing

The integration test entry point is the `integration_test(...)` macro in `integration_testing/integration_testing.bzl`.

See [integration_testing/test](integration_testing/test/BUILD) for an example usage.

## Typical Usage

Run integration tests

```bash
bazel test --config=qemu-integration //tests/integration_test/...
```

These are always run with the QEMU backend.

### Execution Backend Selection

Integration tests are enabled only for QEMU-backed runs:

- Linux QEMU backend: selected when `linux_backend = "qemu"` on Linux.
- QNX backend: selected by target platform (`@platforms//os:qnx`) and uses QNX QEMU artifacts.
- Any other Linux backend value keeps integration tests incompatible, so they are skipped.

### filesystem tar

The tests and their data are packaged into a filesystem tar and either build into (Docker) the image or uploaded after image startup.

### What Runs in QEMU

#### Linux QEMU

If QEMU is selected, the custom plugin [`linux_qemu`](integration_testing/plugins/linux_qemu/README.md) is used.

#### QNX QEMU

For QNX targets, the macro builds a QNX IFS image and passes it to the upstream QEMU ITF plugin with the QNX QEMU config.

### Default Test Parameters Applied by the Macro

Unless explicitly overridden by the test target:

- `size = "enormous"`
- `timeout = "short"`

The macro also always injects `--log-cli-level=DEBUG` for all backends.
